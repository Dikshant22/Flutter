# Flutter
This project is a weather applicaton which shows the weather of the country or city entered by the user or client. 
The setup process for this application is to download android studio and create a emulator from device manager and work on it or download VS code and you can directly download working emulator from VS code but it may sometime crashes as the code gets complicated so would recommend to work on android studio as it has many option for emulator and rarely crashes.
